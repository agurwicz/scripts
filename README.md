# Scripts

Scripts used in my day to day.

Variables in [`variables.txt`](src/variables.txt) need to be defined by the user.
Add the [`src`](src) directory to `$PATH` for access from anywhere.

Each script contains a *help* option that explains its usage. Run it with:
```bash
<script>.sh {-h | --help}
```
