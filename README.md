# Python Management Scripts

Scripts used in my day to day, (re)written in Python for easier cross-platform compatibility.
Special thanks and appropriate credits go to [Lance Endres](https://github.com/lendres) for [initially organizing and improving the Python scripts for Windows](https://github.com/lendres/Python-Scripts).

We are open to suggestions and contributions to the repository. 
Please feel free to open pull requests/issues for contribution and discussion, or fork to add your own scripts.
