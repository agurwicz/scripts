# Python Management Scripts
These scripts are used to quickly and efficiently maintain a _Python_ installation (versions and environments).

## History
1. Originally created by [Allan Gurwicz](https://github.com/agurwicz).
1. Some improvements and additions for _Windows_ by [Lance Endres](https://github.com/lendres).
1. Re-written by Allan in Python for cross-platform compatibility.

## Why Use This Method?
- Anaconda can often hang up trying to resolve packages.  It can take hours or more and can fail even after all that.
- It allows you to rapidly create, update, and delete environments and _Python_ versions.
- Cross-platform compatibility.  The same methods can be used on _macOS_ and _Windows_.
